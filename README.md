                  **Task Group 1: Restaurant Reservation System**
**Scenario:**
You have 1 hour and 15 minutes to develop a restaurant reservation system. Customers should be
able to view available time slots, select a preferred time, and provide necessary details for the
reservation. After completing the implementation, you will have 45 minutes for evaluation.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
1. Create classes for Reservation and Restaurant, each with appropriate attributes and
methods.
2. Implement methods in the Restaurant class to manage available time slots and accept
reservations.
3. Develop a user interface for customers to view available time slots, select a preferred time,
and provide reservation details.
4. Ensure that the system handles reservation requests eƯiciently and updates available time
slots accordingly.
Evaluation (45 minutes):
1. Evaluate the implementation of the Reservation and Restaurant classes, checking if they
are correctly defined with appropriate attributes and methods.
2. Test the reservation functionality to ensure that customers can view available time slots
and make reservations successfully.
3. Assess the user interface for usability and functionality, ensuring that customers can easily
navigate the reservation system and make bookings.

**Submission Instructions:**
1. Upload your code to a public GitHub repository.
2. Run the code and capture the output of the restaurant reservation system.
3. Create a PDF document with the following:
   A list of key classes used in your implementation along with brief descriptions.
   The URL of your GitHub repository properly formatted.
   Screenshots of the running code output, including examples of viewing available
time slots, making reservations, and confirmation messages.
5. Submit the PDF document along with the screenshots of the running code output.
